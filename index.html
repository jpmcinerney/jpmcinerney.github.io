		<p> 
		I began studying physics as an undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts where I completed my B.S. degree with a thesis on ''Critical phenomenoa of Kerr-de Sitter black holes'' under the guidance of the Professor Jennie Traschen.
		Afterwards, I began my PhD at the Georgia Institute of Technology with an initial interest in numerical relativity and LIGO data analysis.
		I have since moved into soft matter theory where my thesis work with Professor Zeb Rocklin is devoted to studying the mechanical properties of periodic origami sheets.

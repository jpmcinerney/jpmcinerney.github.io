		<p> 
		I began studying physics as an undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts where I completed my B.S. degree with a thesis on ''Critical phenomenoa of Kerr-de Sitter black holes'' with the guidance of the Professor Jennie Traschen.
		Afterwards, I began my PhD at the Georgia Institute of Technology with an initial interest in numerical relativity and LIGO data analysis.
		I have since moved into soft matter theory with particular interest in using geometry and topology to control unconventional phases of matter.
		My thesis work is devoted to studying periodic origami sheets.
		I also am continuing work on liquid crystals with curved boundaries and have a growing fascination in the morphology of biological systems.

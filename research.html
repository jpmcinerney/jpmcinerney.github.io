		<p>
		The traditional art of folding paper makes a great model for the deformation of thin sheets with patterns of creases particularly susceptible to bending.
		These models extend from creased paper to articulated metallic plates and even microscopic surfaces such as graphene and polymer layers.
		My interest is in determining how we can pattern these sheets to engineer a particular mechanical response.
